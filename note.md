# Make pages responsive

## Friend Request Page

    - When screen is less than 501px, make the request-list div to take the entire width, change css accordingly to manage white space

## Profile page

    - Write media queries to make page responsive to desktop, tablets and mobile

## Edit Profile page (has two forms to: edit profile and change password)

### For tablet view

    - Adjust the font size of elements and the spacing of form elements, looks exacly the same as desktop view

### For mobile view

- The tabs (edit profile, change password) on the left side of the form should be on top to adjust for less width in mobile view.
- Do so by making the container of form to have flex-direction of column, and make javascript to hide/show corresponding forms
